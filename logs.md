### Day 4: December 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: The last unfinished coding challenge remains unfinished... It was one I had attempted during an interview mockup. I spent another 30 minutes on it today and hit a wall again. I am really gonna celebrate the day that one is finished and marked off my list!

**Thoughts** Today was the first day so far that I didn't want to/didn't feel I had time to code for an hour, but I in my time anyway! Its not only a challenge, its a choice!

### Day 3: December 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Even after just 3 days of focusing in on one language(JavaScript) I can find things coming more easily. While I appreciated the versatility in the materials we covered in my bootcamp, my brain definitely works best with zeroing in on one thing and doing that well.

**Thoughts** I love being able to review other people's solutions after completing a challegne. it is so interesting to see the dozens if not hundreds of ways to solve a single problem!

### Day 2: December 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today went a hell of a lot slower than yesterday. Only made it through one coding challenge, which was a little frustrating when compared to yesterday's 4.

**Thoughts** Today was a good reminder that its less about how much you get done and more about how much effort you put in. I set out to do two things today: 1) code for an hour 2) finish 3 coding challenges. I hit my first goal which is what was most important for the day.

### Day 1: December 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: During my bootcamp with General Assembly, we would often be asked to complete a codewars challenge. Most days we were given a coding challenge, I would become frustrated and discouraged and I rarely finished the challenge. I am starting my 100 days of code by going back through those challenges we were given and finishing them.

**Thoughts** Its funny to look back at how frustrated I was and how much easier the answers come to me now. I was able to quickly work through 4 of my unfinished problems on https://www.codewars.com/ within my hour of coding and tomorrow I will move on to the last 3 I left unfinished.
