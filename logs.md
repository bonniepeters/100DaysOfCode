# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: December 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today went a hell of a lot slower than yesterday. Only made it through one coding challenge, which was a little frustrating when compared to yesterday's 4.

**Thoughts** Today was a good reminder that its less about how much you get done and more about how much effort you put in. I set out to do two things today: 1) code for an hour 2) finish 3 coding challenges. I hit my first goal which is what was most important for the day.

### Day 1: December 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: During my bootcamp with General Assembly, we would often be asked to complete a codewars challenge. Most days we were given a coding challenge, I would become frustrated and discouraged and I rarely finished the challenge. I am starting my 100 days of code by going back through those challenges we were given and finishing them.

**Thoughts** Its funny to look back at how frustrated I was and how much easier the answers come to me now. I was able to quickly work through 4 of my unfinished problems on https://www.codewars.com/ within my hour of coding and tomorrow I will move on to the last 3 I left unfinished.
